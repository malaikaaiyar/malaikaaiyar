title: Hello there!

Welcome to my personal website. This is very scrappy but my resolution was to have _some_ working site in a 2-hour session at [orchard](https://lu.ma/orchard)! Better done than perfect! 

A little bit about me: I'm curious about machine learning, theory of computation, mathematics, the mind, and how they connect. I also love making things by hand and learning about old or analogue processes.

See what I'm up to [[now]]. Coming soon: project logs, art, blog posts, contact info, and more!
