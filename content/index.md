welcome to my personal site! a little bit about me: i'm studying computer science at Oxford, focusing on machine learning, theory of computation, mathematics, the mind, and how they connect.

i also love art, making things by hand, and learning about old or analogue processes. 

leave a [[contact |message]] for me!
