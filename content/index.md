title: Hello there!

Welcome to my personal website. A little bit about me: I'm curious about machine learning, theory of computation, mathematics, the mind, and how they connect. I also love making things by hand and learning about old or analogue processes.

See what I'm up to [[now]]. This site is very scrappy but my resolution was to have _something_ after an [orchard](https://lu.ma/orchard) session! Coming soon: project logs, art, blog posts, and more!
