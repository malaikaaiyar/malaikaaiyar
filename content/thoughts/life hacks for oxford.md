-- i kind of hate this one --

for everyone
- get a bike (great guy for bikes: [Stuart's Bikes](http://www.oxfordbicycles.co.uk/))

things more people should do
- take weekends off
- visit the museums here

food
- cook your own food
- go to gloucester green market to buy things to cook
- rozannas, chickpea, dishoom permit room

cs (and some math) specific!
- do problem sheets before you learn the content in lectures/reading and learn as you go
	- controversial but it saves me so much time! would love to run a study on if this works for other people
- do practicals from home; go to the practical to submit
