draft: true

- [ ] arbox stuff
- convert the slides to text
- recover some code snippets -- probably harder said than done. 1 orchard session of effort i reckon
- was going to do for \[ensemble] but i don't think so. do after ensemble.

- [ ] how to enjoy oxford/university? inspo: anson yu
- action: brainstorm things that make your uni life special/exciting/different
	- not going to theatre/concerts that i am not interested in
	- orchard! and other groups designed for you to do something (but really they're quite good for meeting people) --> branching out from your college and course
	- cooking, dinner parties
	- finding ways to socialise that don't take up productive time (meals, cafe study)
	- engaging with the city outside of the university: markets, talking to locals, events, hackspace, volunteering?
	- moderating amount of formal stuff, un-learning the fomo, being selective
	- grants/money stuff
	- applying for internships/opportunities *early*
- perhaps we will want a chronological record of what's going on? 

- [ ] smth about orchard?
- action: crosspost the orchard log... and also write the hilary term one!

- [ ] ai scientists
- need to know something.. don't rly know much about this. what's the claim, they are useful/have potential? maybe an explainer as you learn stuff? the importance/potential for automation.
- action: read some more stuff!

- [ ] recipes, people and food and memories and stuff
	- lydia & yudhi story about eggs
	- my mom and i about chai
	- my friend group and cooking regular dinners
	- faye and the courgettes, "aphrodisiac"
	- why is food such a good backdrop for a close relationship? is it tension-easing or something? are we all just super hungry all the time? 

- [ ] the pursuit of what to work on, my aesthetic taste in problems
- [ ] maybe a whole post on typesetting/letterpress? 
	- interview Richard Lawrence
	- talk about cool printmaking places/things/types of presses/etc

- [ ] how i use ai
	- hhhhhhh cringe
	- feel like my audience alr uses ai quite a bit
	- maybe things that i don't use AI for and why? (usually low quality/context lack/it's fun to do)
		- recipes
		- graphics
		- completely code things for me

- [ ] catching light, shadows, photo series
	- this could be a really quick low-text thing where i just take my best dslr photos
