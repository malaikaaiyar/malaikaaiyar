title: gathering people & forming friendship
draft: true
---
The concept of 'people', in places I exist, has been on my mind a lot lately. I've been far more intentional with meeting people than I ever have in my life. 

In the first year of university, my strategy was something like: let people come to you, and give everyone a chance. Be palatable, kind, outgoing, but yourself (vulnerable, some comfortable 'oversharing')-- and people will see you as someone who they should be friends with. 

This works -- in that I have a great set of friends now, but my problem with it is that I can't really make people come to me, or get more friends if I want to. Also, the types of friends I develop 

This term in Oxford I've put significant energy into meeting people 
- orchard
- gatherings in my space
- coffee chats/lunches/walks

- things i host/background
- how to do it well
	- it's really easy
	- indian warmth
	- using when2meet
	- not having a gc for ppl you invite
	- mysteriousness
	- creating schelling points?
- can i/should i expect the same thing of people who come?
	- does being a host ruin the dynamic permanently?
	- having spoken to other initiative-taking people feel this way
- i encourage the reader to host something, and invite me (or your local initiative-taking person)
