title: gathering people
draft: true
---
This term in Oxford I've put significant energy into meeting people 
- orchard
- gatherings in my space -- ghazal story
- coffee chats/lunches/walks


- things i host/background
- how to do it well
	- it's really easy
	- indian warmth
	- using when2meet
	- not having a gc for ppl you invite
	- mysteriousness
	- creating schelling points?
- can i/should i expect the same thing of people who come?
	- does being a host ruin the dynamic permanently?
	- having spoken to other initiative-taking people feel this way
- i encourage the reader to host something, and invite me (or your local initiative-taking person)
