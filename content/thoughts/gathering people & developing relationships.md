title: gathering people
draft: true
---
This term in Oxford I've put significant energy into meeting people 
- orchard
- gatherings in my space
- coffee chats/lunches/walks



- things i host/background
- how to do it well
	- it's really easy
	- indian culture and hosting
- can i/should i expect the same thing of people who come?
	- does being a host ruin the dynamic permanently?
	- other initiative-taking people feel this way
