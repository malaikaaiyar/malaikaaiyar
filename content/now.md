currently exploring what kind of work i'd like to do, which involves doing more technical projects and learning about the world more broadly. i'm continuing to host [orchard](https://lu.ma/orchard), trying to document life on my camera, thinking about starting a podcast, helping out with a literary [magazine](https://follymagazine.org), and I have a goal of making a [lino print](printmaking) weekly this term. i also want to write more regularly on this blog, and maybe even redesign it!
